# Linear Coupled Troposphere Stratosphere Model

This is a linear, coupled troposphere-stratosphere model. Configure the namelist file as you see fit. The default namelist is configured such that the MJO-like mode in the linear model is the fastest growing mode.  Note the variable *exp_name*, which is the experiment name. The output of the model and corresponding analysis will be found in that folder.

To run the model, use:
`run_model('namelist.txt')`
